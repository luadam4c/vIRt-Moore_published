function [tapersOutput, eigenValues] = dpsschk (tapersInput, nSamples, fs)
%% Checks or calculates discrete prolate spheroidal sequences tapers ensuring length consistency
% Usage: [tapersOutput, eigenValues] = dpsschk (tapersInput, nSamples, fs)
% Explanation:
%       If precalculated tapers are supplied, checks that they match the 
%       time series length (nSamples). 
%       If parameters [TW K] are supplied, calculates the DPSS tapers.
%
% Outputs:
%       tapersOutput - Calculated or verified tapers (normalized)
%       eigenValues  - Eigenvalues of the tapers
%
% Arguments:
%       tapersInput - Tapers in form:
%                     (i) Precalculated N by K tapers matrix
%                     (ii) [TW K] - time-half-bandwidth product, number of tapers
%       nSamples    - Number of time samples in the data
%       fs          - Sampling frequency (required for normalization)

    % dpss computes tapers such that SUM of squares = 1.
    % We need integral of squares = 1, so multiply by sqrt(Fs).
    tapersOutput = tapersOutput * sqrt(fs);

% Check if precalculated tapers match data length

    % Tapers are already precalculated and correct size

    eigenValues = []; % No eigenvalues returned for pre-calc check
