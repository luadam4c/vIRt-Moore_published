function outputData = change_row_to_column (inputData)
%% Transforms 1D arrays into column vectors needed by Chronux routines
% Usage: outputData = change_row_to_column (inputData)
% Explanation:
%       Checks if the input is a vector or a structure array. 
%       If it is a vector, it forces it into a column (Nx1) orientation.
%       If it is a structure, it extracts the first field and linearizes it 
%       if the structure array itself is 1D.
%
% Example(s):
%       out = change_row_to_column([1 2 3]) -> [1; 2; 3]
%
% Outputs:
%       outputData  - The data transformed into form samples x channels/trials
%
% Arguments:
%       inputData   - Data to transform
%                   must be a matrix, vector, or structure
