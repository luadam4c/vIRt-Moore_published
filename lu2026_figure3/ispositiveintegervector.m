function isPositiveIntegerVector = ispositiveintegervector (x)
%% Returns whether an input is a positive integer vector
% Usage: isPositiveIntegerVector = ispositiveintegervector (x)
% Explanation:
%       Tests whether the input is a positive integer vector
% Example(s):
%       ispositiveintegervector(1:10)
%       ispositiveintegervector(magic(3))
%       ispositiveintegervector(-1:3)
% Outputs:
%       isPositiveIntegerVector
%                       - whether the input is a positive integer vector
%                       specified as a logical scalar
% Arguments:    
%       x               - an input to check
