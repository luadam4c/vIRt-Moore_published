function [phaseReset, phaseChange, relativeResetTime, T0, T1, eventTimeBefore, eventTimeBeforeBefore] = ...
    compute_phase_response (eventTimes, resetTime, toCompute)
%% Compute phase response from event times and a reset time
% Usage: [phaseReset, phaseChange, relativeResetTime, T0, T1, eventTimeBefore, eventTimeBeforeBefore] = ...
%   compute_phase_response (eventTimes, resetTime, toCompute)
% Explanation:
%       This function computes the phase reset and phase change given a series of
%       rhythmic event times and a single reset event time.
%
% Outputs:
%       phaseReset      - The phase of the reset time within the cycle.
%                       specified as a numeric scalar
%       phaseChange     - The change in phase caused by the reset.
%                       specified as a numeric scalar
%       relativeResetTime   - The time of the reset relative to the preceding event.
%                       specified as a numeric scalar
%       T0              - The unperturbed inter-event interval.
%                       specified as a numeric scalar
%       T1              - The perturbed inter-event interval.
%                       specified as a numeric scalar
%       eventTimeBefore - The time of the event immediately before the reset.
%                       specified as a numeric scalar
%       eventTimeBeforeBefore - The time of the event two cycles before the reset.
%                       specified as a numeric scalar
%
% Arguments:
%       eventTimes      - A vector of event times (e.g., whisk peaks).
%                       must be a numeric vector
%       resetTime       - The time of the resetting event (e.g., breath onset).
%                       must be a numeric scalar
%       toCompute       - A logical flag to indicate if computation is needed.
%                       must be a logical scalar
